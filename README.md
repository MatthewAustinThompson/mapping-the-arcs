Canterbury Roll: Mapping the Arcs Internship Project

The goal of the Mapping the Arcs project was to create a network or tree visualization of relationships between the over 600 historical figures who appear in Noah's genealogical tree known as the Canterbury Roll. It had to be easily and intuitively explorable by all users, especially near the bottom of the Roll due to that sectionâ€™s visual complexity. Ideally, the visualization would also include the colors of the arcs, or connecting lines between people, used by the scribes and the types of relationships displayed. The project was completed under the supervision and with the resources of the University of Canterbury Arts Digital Lab.
